Hello baby girl its your special day,
so happy birthday to the princess who slays

This card is a small piece of our relationship together,
one i cherish so dearly and pray will last forever.

I know I ramble on about how the stars twirled,
but all you should know is that youre my world.

Youre now 22, and I still smell a bit like poo
but my heart will always be beating strongly around you.

So heres to all the up and down we've been through,
and the distance ones that approach our view.

We'll breeze through them with a checkmate,
or just like the pubg bots you obliterate

You have become the thing that makes me whole,
also getting the dark brown hairs from my mole.

All im trying to say is your my darling, 
and without you, id be starving

Youre filled with so much joy and laughter,
you make me forget about the bad stuff that could come after.

"i hope i never lose you" are common words from my mouth,
but everytime you let me know things wont go south

I know youre determination will get you close to becoming a doctor,
you just gotta work hard, and deal with all those nasty proctors.

Life is a dream with you in it,
I hope i never wake up and realize youre not in it.

I know my rhyming might be off 
so hopefully you dont think this is a turnoff

From your toes, to your smile and the hole on your bum,
a spark exists between us that makes me numb

I love you with all my hearts, 
something that youd clearly see if you checked my charts

So i wish all the best from the the tip of my penis, 
i love you my favorites, my tinky little genus
